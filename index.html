			<p>Norman Mark Reedus (born January 6, 1969) is an American actor and model, best known for his role as Daryl Dixon on the AMC horror drama series The Walking Dead, and as Murphy MacManus in The Boondock Saints. He has also acted in numerous films, appeared in and created several videos, provided video game voiceovers, and modeled for various fashion designers (most recognizably Prada in the 1990s).</p>
			<p>The Walking Dead
In 2010, Reedus began playing Daryl Dixon in the AMC television series The Walking Dead, a horror drama about a group of friends and family members who fight to survive in a violent apocalyptic world populated with flesh-eating zombies and the few surviving humans, some of whom are even more diabolical and dangerous than the zombies themselves. The character was not originally in the comic book series of the same name, but was created specifically for Reedus after his audition for the character of Merle Dixon. The Walking Dead comic creator Robert Kirkman feels "absolutely blessed Reedus has honored the show with his presence, and the way he has come in and taken over that role and defined Daryl Dixon. A lot of Reedus's portrayal of the character in the first season inspired all the writers to do what we did with him in the second season. We love writing him and end up doing cool stuff with him." The drama has evolved into the highest-rated in cable history, smashing all previous records.[14] Reedus was nominated for a 2012 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Dixon.</p>
